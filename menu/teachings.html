          <p>As educators, professors have two essential duties: delivering quality lectures and facilitating students' learning. Teaching allows me to fulfill one aspect of my mission as I believe students attend universities to learn and become productive society members. My teaching mission is aimed towards:
            Helping students achieve their potential in academia and in the I.T. industry.</p>
          <p>As a professor, I take it upon myself to assist my students in comprehending the fundamental principles of Computer Science/Engineering and their proper application in industrial projects and academic research. I also include exercises that cultivate technical problem-solving abilities and employ current industrial tools and technologies. It is the professors' duty to produce skilled professionals who can develop I.T. systems of varying complexity levels to meet their clients' needs.
            As a professor and student, I have reflected on my experience to develop my pedagogical style. I have also incorporated best practices from teaching training and certificate programs to enhance my style.</p>

            <p>A key priority during my tenure at TAMIU has been to advance academic programs. When I interviewed with TAMIU in March 2018, I expressed a strong interest in establishing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering program, as well as a Computer Science curriculum. This vision has since become a reality. I played a pivotal role in developing this new program by actively participating in curriculum design, course development, and preparation for ABET accreditation.</p>
            <p>As noted in the Courses Taught Table below, I have developed and taught more than 12 new courses for both the Computer Engineering and Computer Science programs. These courses are designed with a focus on student learning outcomes and effective teaching methodologies. They encompass a diverse range of topics and delivery methods, including both face-to-face and online formats that adhere to Quality Matters (QM) standards. My contributions to curriculum development reflect my commitment to providing students with a high-quality, contemporary education that prepares them for successful careers in the ever-evolving fields of computer science and engineering.</p>

            <p>To cultivate a dynamic and engaging learning environment, I integrate my research interests seamlessly into my classroom instruction. By exposing students to cutting-edge research in software engineering, data science, and cybersecurity, I encourage a deeper understanding of course concepts and inspire them to explore their own research questions. For example, I actively involve students in my research projects, collaborating with them on the development of novel techniques and tools for creating complex software systems, as well as developing large datasets for intrusion detection and phishing detection. This hands-on experience enhances their technical skills and fosters critical thinking, problem-solving, and independent research abilities. The positive impact of this approach is reflected in consistently high student evaluations, demonstrating their appreciation for the unique and enriching learning opportunities I provide.</p>

The first course, Software Engineering-WIN (CSCE 4201), aimed to equip students with the technical writing skills necessary for adequate software documentation and collaboration. The second course was Computer Engineering Senior Design Project-WIN (CSCE 4390), where I guided students in honing their research writing and presentation skills, leading to impactful project proposals and defenses.</p>
          <p class="lead">Apart from the course content, I actively embraced the WIN designation's emphasis on communication development. I collaborated with Karol Batey to conduct thorough WIN assessments, identify areas for improvement, and implement effective strategies. I integrated writing assignments and workshops aligned directly with WIN learning outcomes, such as clarity, structure, and professional presentation. I provided personalized feedback on writing assignments, fostering confident and polished communicators.</p>

The professor had a great way of teaching and the real life comparisons made machine learning a lot simpler to understand. The questions asked by the professor kept you engaged in the class, and although at times I answered with uncertainty, the professor always gave a good explanation if I was wrong. I recommend the students to engage with the professor as much as possible since Dr Al Lail is a caring professor who does his best to help you.</p>

                      <p class="card-text">Dr. Al-Lail makes classes very fun and interesting. It feels rewarding and engaging to be in his classes because you know for a fact that everything he teaches is of value in the class; there are not wasted lectures or content that does not serve a purpose in the class. Also, his assignments build upon these concepts, so it never feels like you were never provided the tools to solve the assignments or complete exams correctly.</p>

                      <p>Although the class is online Dr. Al Lail had everything organized in a way that we could always go back and watch the video or read a chapter again if there were any questions. During the videos he took us step by step as if we were actually taking the class presently which is something that i enjoyed. Him constantly updating us and reassuring us through emails that we could reach out to him or the SI mentor was something that I enjoyed and it made me feel less nervous about asking questions. The material was hard but we were always motivated to ask questions if there were any which is something I was very thankful for.</p>

                      <p>Everything about this course fun, cool, and intriguing. Within the first 30 min of the first lesson you are already writing a code, basic though it may have been, but to see a program output what your code told it to made me smile. This course has been hands down my favorite while here at TAMIU. Great Job Professor!!! Another key factor was the response time from the Professor, if you had a question or concern, it was answered within the hour. Great course.</p>

                      <p>What I liked the most about this course was the way that the work was organized. Despite the course covering what would normally be covered in three months, I didn't really feel too rushed or anything. I am not a computer science major, so I thought I was going to have a really hard time with the material, but I found the textbook for the class to be really helpful. I am actually surprised at how much I enjoyed the class. I am not saying everything was ridiculously easy, but I did like how it was challenging enough for me. I also really appreciated how understanding Dr. Al Lail was when it came to the extension of some due dates. He also replied fairly fast whenever I had a question, and I really appreciate it since this was an online class.</p>
