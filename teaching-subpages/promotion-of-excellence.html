          <h2 class="fw-light py-2">Promotion of Excellence In Undergraduate Research</h2>
          <p class="lead">I involve undergraduate students in my research to prepare the next generation of scholars. My goal is to foster student learning and produce original research results. Undergraduate research helps students gain functional knowledge, critical thinking skills, and problem-solving abilities. I have supervised many undergraduate research projects, which have resulted in success for students, including graduate school enrollment and IT industry positions. My interest in undergraduate research began when I was a Ph.D. student at Colorado State University. My advisor hired an undergraduate researcher assistant to create code implementation of a theoretical approach that he had developed. I witnessed the assistant develop the code and then present his work at a premier conference in software engineering. I was inspired by my advisor's approach to undergraduate research. When I first arrived at TAMIU, I aimed to apply a similar approach and positively impact undergraduate education. In the spring of 2019, I participated in a training hosted by the School of Business at TAMIU called "Developing Employability Skills Through Undergraduate Research." This training was enlightening, and I have since utilized many of the techniques and abilities presented to help my students become more desirable in the IT industry through undergraduate research. Additionally, I attended TAMIU ARC's online workshop on "Optimizing Mentoring Relationships", where I learned valuable skills to mentor my students more effectively.</p>

        <div class="row p-2">
          <div class="col-12 col-md-7 order-md-1">
            <p class="lead">I have introduced a new approach to mentoring undergraduate researchers, combining my experience in mentoring with the best practices in teaching . By utilizing seven research-based principles for effective teaching, I have successfully motivated and engaged undergraduate students in their research projects, boosting their chances of success. I have supervised a total of 20 research projects involving 34 students. A summary of undergraduate research activities is provided in a table in the second dossier, along with the names of the students. I have also participated in mentoring summer research experience for undergraduates (REU) at Columbus State University, resulting in several poster presentations at conferences. One of these posters even won third place at the 8th national workshop for REU research in networking and systems. Additionally, the second dossier contains links to video recordings of several students' presentations, which were published in professional avenues. Undergraduate research has made a significant impact on the success of students. So far, five students have enrolled in graduate studies at different institutions, seven students have secured positions in the IT industry (some of which before graduating), and two students joined me to participate in a research internship at a Department of Energy lab this last summer. The remaining are still pursuing their degrees. Based on the success I have had with my mentoring style, I decided to share my experience with other TAMIU faculty. I gave a presentation on how to mentor undergraduate researchers to TAMIU faculty during the 13th annual learning technologies week. I have been invited to give the same training again the past Spring through the TAMIU ARC project. Furthermore, my supervisor, Dr. Mahmoud T. Khasawneh, has recommended my name to deliver training to the Texas A&M System Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (TAMUS LSAMP) undergraduate students to boost their skillsets to do research.</p>

          <h2 class="fw-light py-2"> Sample Student Conference Oral Presentations</h2>
          <p class="lead">I am deeply committed to providing students with authentic research experiences that extend beyond the classroom. A cornerstone of my mentoring philosophy is actively engaging students in all stages of the research process, from conceptualization and data collection to analysis, writing, and dissemination. I believe that co-authoring research papers and presenting at conferences offer invaluable opportunities for students to develop critical thinking, communication, and professional skills, all while making meaningful contributions to their fields.</p>
          <p class="lead">I have had the privilege of mentoring numerous students who have gone on to co-author peer-reviewed publications and present their work at local and national conferences. My approach involves a collaborative process where students are integrated into the research team as active participants. I provide guidance and support throughout the writing process, helping students refine their ideas, develop strong arguments, and craft clear and concise manuscripts. Similarly, I work closely with students to prepare for conference presentations, assisting them with everything from designing effective slides to practicing their delivery and answering questions from the audience.</p>
          <p class="lead">I believe these experiences are transformative, empowering students to gain valuable research skills and build confidence in their abilities as scholars and professionals. Witnessing my students succeed in these arenas is incredibly rewarding and reinforces my commitment to fostering the next generation of researchers and scholars. Additionally, these experiences contribute to the university's research mission and enhance the visibility of our programs.</p>
          <p class="lead">Below, you can view samples of many of the oral and poster presentations created by my students under my supervision and presented at various venues.</p>

                      <li class="card-text"><b>Abstract:</b> Model-driven engineering (MDE) has been criticized for its lack of good tooling. Although advances have been made, most MDE analysis tools rely on techniques and notations that complicate the analysis process. These tools also do not align well with the MDE methods and practitioners. In particular, to analyze temporal properties of systems designed using UML, many approaches opt to use heavyweight mathematical formalisms to specify properties while transforming the UML models to model- checking technologies for verification. This approach introduces accidental complexities. Therefore, we created Temporal Property Validator (TPV), a tool that allows designers to specify and analyze temporal properties using UML notations, techniques, and tools. The goal is to create a tool that eliminates the complexities and amplifies the skills of UML designers in developing reliable software.

Such a network can be beneficial most of the time, but how secure are they? IoT devices aren't as safe as we may think. The manufacturer decided to pursue a better performance over security, which could compromise our data. In this research, we determine if implementing a machine learning algorithm is worth it by using the ID (intrinsic dimensionality) values of eight data sets that help determine its complexity by using both euclidean and hamming distances along which six machine learning algorithms. The Evaluation of the model will help determine if the complexity of datasets truly represents the benefits of implementing machine learning algorithms.</li>

                      <li class="card-text"><b>Abstract:</b>Predicting oil production for different shale oil reservoirs is a non-trivial problem that highly influences the field appraisal and production planning in the Petroleum Engineering (PE) industry. Different reservoir characteristics are used to indicate production rate profiles including oil rate, gas rate, and average reservoir pressure. The recent trend in predicting oil production rates is based on Machine Learning (ML) algorithms. Even though ML algorithms have been applied to a variety of oil production datasets, there is a need to evaluate the capabilities of different ML algorithms to solve PEs’ non-linear, high-dimensional prediction problems. This paper presents a performance evaluation of four ML models: Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), Random Forest (RF), Neural Network (NN), and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The evaluation results indicate that NN and XGB perform better than either SVM or RF. Specifically, the NN model had an error rate of 3.32%, which outperformed other models in predicting the oil and gas rates. The XGB model outperformed others in predicting average reservoir pressure with an error rate of 3.83%. To obtain the best performance of all outputs, we combined the NN and the XGB models, reducing the error rate to 2.84% which is lower than either individual component. </li>

                    <li><b>Abstract:</b> The increasing dependency on digital technology has made the concept of data security an important concern. Not only how information is accessed, but also where and when have become important considerations in cyber-security. Certain situations exist where it is necessary to restrict access based on time and location. An example is a policy for a medical institution where doctors can only access patient records at hospitals during their shifts. The Generalized Spatio-Temporal Role-Based Access Control model (GSTRBAC) determines users’ access to resources based on such information. This paper describes a software architecture and its current implementation of the GSTRBAC model. </li>
